    <h1> Lab 10: Javascript for the Web </h1>


    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p>Challenges for this lab was sort the input name and print the output in the doc.
      I researched how to use these in an html file and was able to connect the js file in the last lab. So we should be able to do this easily.</p>
    <h2>Problems </h2>
    <p>The problem that I faced was we can't print the output which already in the console.
      By comparing the code of the Wed's website, we finally figure it out.
      We also use the window prompt to replace the hitbox to forming the name(input).  </p>
    <h2>Results </h2>
    <p>Here are the results of the code that I used for my index.html file. Here is the program execution:</p>
    <div id = "duh">
      <h2> Script Input</h2>
    <button type = "sortUserName()">button </button>
  </div>
  <h2> Script Output</h2>
      <div id = "output">
          <p>Here is your fixed name!</p>
          <button type = "printline()">fixed name </button>
  </div>
