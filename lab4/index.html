		<h1>Challenge</h1>
		<p>The two problems we tackled in this lab was "How to Hunt a Nergigante in Monster Hunter: World" for the everyday pesudocode task and "How to Build an Algorithm to Solve a Sudoku Game."
			We were tasked with making accurate, step by step instructions for doing larger tasks. Our goal was to make the tasks flow logically and be small enough to be both understandable and actionable.

		<h1>Problems</h1>
		<p>Some problems that we faced during the lab was first agreeing on a large task to break down. We settled on a task from a video game that we both knew very well. For the other large task, we took
			an idea from lecture and changed it so that we were solving the Sudoku puzzle instead of creating one. We also had differences in opinions on where to start explaining the steps and how much prior experience/background knowledge
			to assume from the viewer, and we agreed on very basic knowledge and starting point. We also had some trouble with formatting the CSS of the index page, especially with the &lt;pre&gt; tag.

<pre>1. Buy Monster Hunter: World on platform of choice (Steam/PS4/Xbox).
  a. If you have already hunted a Nergigante before, skip to Step 5.
2. Install Monster Hunter: World to your device.
3. Progress through Monster Hunter: World until you encounter Nergigante.
  a. Follow the game’s instructions on how to move and handle weapons.
  b. Choose your favourite weapon and become familiar with it’s moves.
  c. Read the quest descriptions to understand the objective of quests.
  d. Track the objective down and complete the task (Gather, Deliver, Hunt, Slay)
    i. Gather - Collect items by using the interact (default: right-click, Circle, or B) button.
   ii. Deliver - Pick up items by using the interact button and carry them back to camp.
  iii. Hunt - Slay or capture the target monster(s).
   iv. Slay - Slay the target monster(s).
4. Collect Nergigante tracks on Quests or Expeditions.
5. Depart on a Quest to slay Nergigante.
6. Track Nergigante down.
7. Nergigante can be found in Area 14 of Elder’s Recess.
8. Hunt a Nergigante.
  a. Watch the state of it’s spikes -- they will grow and change colors from white to black throughout the fight. If they are black, its attacks grow stronger and your weapon will bounce. You can avoid this by destroying the spikes before they turn black (while they are still white).
  b. Focus your attacks on the spikes, breaking a certain amount of spikes will cause Nergigante to become staggered.
  c. Do not attempt to use traps or capture Nergigante; they will not work because it is an Elder Dragon.
  d. When it’s HP becomes low, it will head back to area 15 to rest. Be careful with its power spike. It hurts a lot in the last area.</pre>

<pre>// 1. Convert the unsolved Sudoku grid into numbers.
//   a. Existing numbers remain the same, with blank spaces becoming 0.
// 2. Check for boxes (3x3), rows, or columns that have exactly 1 missing number (ignore rows marked as solved).
//   a. Fill in the missing number and mark as solved.
// 3. Check for boxes, rows, or columns that have exactly 2 missing numbers (ignore rows marked as solved).
//   a. Figure out what those 2 numbers are.
//   b. Check the boxes, rows, or columns that the blank spaces are in for those 2 numbers.
//     i. If 1 of those numbers is found, fill in that blank space with the other number, fill in the other blank space with that number, and mark as solved.
//    ii. If 0 of those numbers are found, ignore.
//   iii. If 2 numbers are found, exit program, report error.
// 4. Check for boxes, rows, or columns that have exactly 3 missing numbers (ignore rows marked as solved).
//   a. Figure out what those 3 numbers are.
//   b. Check the boxes, rows, or columns that the blank spaces are in for those 3 numbers.
//     i. If 2 of those numbers are found, fill in that blank space with the other number, fill in the other blank space with that number.
//    ii. If 1 of those numbers is found, mark that blank space as ‘[number]-impossible.’
//       1. If another blank space is also marked as ‘[same number]-impossible,’ fill in the remaining, unmarked blank space with that number.
//   iii. If 0 of those numbers are found, ignore.
//    iv. If 3 numbers are found, exit program, report error.
// 5. Repeat from Step 2 until the grid is solved.
//   a. If there are no more boxes, rows, or columns to check and the grid is still unsolved, start again from the top.
//   b. The program only checks boxes, rows, and columns for up to 3 missing numbers and may become stuck if the solution solves a box, row or column that requires 4+ missing numbers.
//   c. A solved grid will have no repeat numbers in each box, row, or column.
//   d. There is only one solution to each sudoku grid. If there is no solution the program will return an error.</pre>
