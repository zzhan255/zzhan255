    <h1> Lab 12: Conditionals </h1>
    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p> The challenges for this lab was figuring out the proper syntax for jquery before I was able to understand creating the js file
    </p>
    <h2>Problems </h2>
    <p>Problems that we faced was getting the button to work properly in the jquery and applying the final toggleClass function so it can work in the index.html file. </p>
    <h2>Results </h2>
    <p>The results are shown in the buttons, each button does the same thing which is to change text to cursive, although it doesnâ€™t change all the text.</p>
    <div class="input-output">
