    <h1> Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web </h1>


    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p>Challenges for this lab were using getElementById and the appendchild function. I researched how to use these in an html file and was able to connect the js file.</p>
    <h2>Problems </h2>
    <p>The problem that I faced was accidentally not capitalizing the b in the getElementById function and I spent a couple minutes realizing my mistake. However, after this we were able to correctly finish the js code after we realized the mistake. </p>
    <h2>Results </h2>
    <p> The results for our lab is shown below, we were able to use getElementById and appendChild properly, however we required to use a textNode in order to refer to the index.html file. </p>
