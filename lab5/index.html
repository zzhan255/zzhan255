		<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<p>Experimentation with basic variables in JS.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>We had some previous experience with coding and JS so basic variables weren't much of a problem
		for our group; however, we had some issues when we were deciding on the contents of the site
		or trying to style the output site.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>We had some issues with styling the output of our JS. The solution was to put it inside
		a separate &lt;div&gt; tag and just style the entire div instead of trying to style the text.
		Also, both of us have never owned a car, so we settled on a car that an uncle used to have (a red 1994
		Hyundai Elantra).
		Additionally, my partner's Teletype for Atom extension wasn't working at all, so we had to have one person screenshare
		and type while the other person watches and tells them what to do.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Here is our JavaScript short's output, styled in console format.</p>
		<h3>&emsp;Script Output</h3>
		<div id="script-output">
			<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>
