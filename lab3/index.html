        <h2>Purpose of this lab</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this lab was to get more familiar creating local file
            structures on our personal computers and to better understand and script
            html files.</p>

        <h2>Struggles we came across</h2>
        <p>The biggest struggle we came across was formatting all of the graphical
            features so they lined up properly. It's hard to figure out the web page
            structure and where everything is going to end up when you are  edit pixels
            and percentages at a time. </p>

        <h2>Results of our work</h2>
        <p>As you can see with this page, and through the screengrabs of our own
            homepages, we are finally starting to get a hang of this.<br>
            One thing Tristan was happy to achieve was the horizontal navigation bar
            at the top of his homepage, where the tabs change color when the cursor
            hovers above it.
